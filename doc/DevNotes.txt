Content Index/Search
======================================
NOTE:   MySQL limits the return results: If result count > 50% of the total records in the table, MySQL will not
        return ANY results!  Beware of this if small number of documents in library

'Boolean' Full-Text Searches
    - Uses 'IN BOOLEAN MODE' modifier
    - Does not user '50% threshold'
    - Supported Operators:
        '+' word MUST be present in each row returned
        '-' word MUST NOT be present in each row returned, NOTE: Only used to return to exclude rows that are matched
                by other search terms NOT returns 'all rows except those containing any of the excluded terms'
        (no operator) implies words are 'OR'd together
        '>' increases the contribution to the relevance value
        '<' decreases the contribution to the relevance value
        '(...)' group words into subexpressions (can be nested)
        '~' causes the word's contribution to the row's relevance to be negative..does not exclude the row
        '*' wildcard operator
        '"' defines search "phrase"


Multi-File Uploader
======================================
Will attempt to use HTML5 uploader 1st: Tested with:
    - Chrome (16.0.912.75 - Windows)
    - Chrome (16.0.912.63 - Linux)
    - FireFox (9.0.1 - Windows)
    - FireFox (6.0 - Linux)
    - Safari (5.1.2 - Windows)

If HTML5 not supported, then fallback to Flash uploader. Tested with:
    Internet Explorer (9.0.8112.16421 - Windows)

If HTML5 not supported AND Flash is not installed OR browser is Opera fallback to IFrame uploader. Tested with:
    IE 9 no flash (9.0.8112.16421 - Windows)
    IE 8 no flash (8.0.7600.16385 - Windows)
    Opera (11.60 - Windows)
    Opera (11.60 - Linux)

NOTES:
    - If IFrame uploader is used the user will not be able to select multiple files in the File Explorer.
    - If IFrame uploader is used, the file size and type are not available until the upload completes
    - Currently there is no way to remove documents from the add list
