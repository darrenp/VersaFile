Content Index/Search
======================================
NOTE:   MySQL limits the return results: If result count > 50% of the total records in the table, MySQL will not
        return ANY results!  Beware of this if small number of documents in library

Multi-File Uploader
======================================
Will attempt to use HTML5 uploader 1st: Tested with:
    - Chrome (16.0.912.75 - Windows)
    - Chrome (16.0.912.63 - Linux)
    - FireFox (9.0.1 - Windows)
    - FireFox (6.0 - Linux)
    - Safari (5.1.2 - Windows)

If HTML5 not supported, then fallback to Flash uploader. Tested with:
    Internet Explorer (9.0.8112.16421 - Windows)

If HTML5 not supported AND Flash is not installed OR browser is Opera fallback to IFrame uploader. Tested with:
    IE 9 no flash (9.0.8112.16421 - Windows)
    IE 8 no flash (8.0.7600.16385 - Windows)
    Opera (11.60 - Windows)
    Opera (11.60 - Linux)

NOTES:
    - If IFrame uploader is used the user will not be able to select multiple files in the File Explorer.
    - If IFrame uploader is used, the file size and type are not available until the upload completes
    - Currently there is no way to remove documents from the add list
